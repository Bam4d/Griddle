Where is the macOS version?
---------------------------

Griddly uses the vulkan rendering engine which mac does not support very well. Fortunately there is a project called MoltenVK that aims to bridge this gap. MoltenVK currently has `some bugs <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/issues/908>`_ which mean that Griddly will not function on macOS just yet.
Hopefully in the near future these bugs will be fixed in the vulkan SDK for macOS and griddly will be updated! Watch this space!
